# Soils

## Define Bounds 

This is just a helper function but it could still benefit from some comments, even just a header describing the arguments and output of the function. 

AW: A description of the function, its motivation, and what it outputs was added to the top of the script.

## 1.1 Downloading Soils

Some of the comments in this script are more geared towards what you are doing rather than why you are doing it. 

AW: I added motivation explanations below each section heading.

For instance, why are you using bounding boxes and quadrants rather than the outline of the state? Is it so that the paleon grids work? I am especially curious because you seem to bind the quadrants back together at the end of this script (lines 471-475).

AW: I tried to explain this under section 1 of this script. The reason is because downloading for the whole state at one time is only possible at lower resolution because of limitations of the soilDB package and my computer's RAM. Dividing and processing the data in smaller, square chunks allowed me to use higher resolution data. Yes, everything gets combined again at the end, once the data have been processed into a more efficient format. This probably could be done better if I knew more about the soilDB package/raster package but I don't because it's being deprecated. This is sufficient for the scale of soil data we need across current PalEON projects.

What does RAT stand for?

AW: It stands for Raster Attribute Table. I added this to the beginning of the section.

Intermediate outputs from this step (gssurgo_average_030_700m.Rdata) would be helpful to have.

AW: It was added to the data/raw/soils/ path.

The save line (480) points to a folder that does not exist (data/raw/soils). I do not think that the save command can create a new folder in R. Did you move this folder over when you took out the large raw data instead of just moving the data itself? 

AW: I forgot to push the empty folder. I added the folder and its contents based on your above request.

## 1.2 Downloading Floodplains

All the state coordinates match those in the previous script. 
All the numbering of variables match up (i.e. no typos in variable assignment). 
Projection types match those in the previous script. 

gSSURGO changed things so I can't do a lot of tests on the outputs of these steps but the provided plotting code seems sufficient to test whether the coordinates fall within the correct states and the floodplains make sense with the geography of each state. 

Intermediate outputs from this step (gssurgo_floodplain_030_700m.Rdata) would be helpful to have. 

AW: I added this to the data/raw/soils/ path.

Same issue with the save line (541) as in script 1.1. Directory data/raw/soils does not exist. 

AW: This is resolved as stated above.

## 1.3 Gridded soils

This script loads data from the data/raw/soils folder which is not included in the repo. 

AW: Sorry about this. It is now added.

I still don't have the inputs to this file but the plotting makes sense for checking that the soil data matches spatially and is plausible.
 
Line 64: Here you are using the df_soil data frame. Where is this defined? You seem to have a df_soil3 data frame in line 42, is this what you are plotting? 

AW: This was an error. The object is now renamed df_soil.

I am a little bit confused about the transformation section in lines 80-93. Since you already converted all the data to EPSG:4326 in the previous two scripts why are you now transforming them to a different projection?

AW: Originally, I was matching things using EPSG:4326. My updated workflow uses EPSG:3175, which is the projection used for all PalEON spatial data. Unfortunately, I can't go back and update this in files 1-1 and 1-2 because gSSURGO is broken. However, translating between these projections does not create any issues in this region. This can be checked by translating back and forth between EPSG:4326 and EPSG:3175 and seeing if there is any difference in the coordinates (there would only be difference on the order of 10e-10 degrees). 

Line 98: This is quite nitpicky but it would be helpful to say where in the repo this data is.

AW: No problem! Fixed.

Lines 101 & 104: These paths go outside the repository. Could you instead have people download them from the other repository but create a standardized place for them within the R project and provide the path to that location?

AW: I added a description of where files should be downloaded to as a comment. Then, I used an if statement to allow the file to be loaded directly from the external repository of from the appropriate directory that the files were downlaoded to if it exists. The new directories are data/processed/PLS and data/processed/FIA.

Line 114-118: I am confused by this section. From your comments in 106-108 I was expecting this section to find cells that match between the two datasets and remove ones that do not match. However, you seem to be making a list of all the locations that are in one of the two datasets. When do you compare across the two? (i.e. it seems you are finding a union rather than an intersection) 

AW: I am taking any grid cell and its coordinates that exist in either of the two dataests OR both of the datasets. We want to estimate soil conditions for every grid cell that exists in either dataset. I added more explanation of this in a comment.

Also, do you know why the pls dataset goes from ~47,000 rows in stem_density_agg2 to ~7,000 in pls_grid? Are there lots of plots in the same grid cells?

AW: This is just because stem_density_agg2 is in long format, with each taxon in each grid cell having a separate row. For pls_unique_grid, I select only the columns associated with a grid cell (coordinates), and then use the distinct() function to take only unique rows, so each row now represents a grid cell, not a taxon. I added an explanation of this to the right of the distinct() function.

Line 144: find all soil points within rather than climate. 

AW: Fixed.

Line 251: Are all the rows without clay missing all the soil variables? Are there no lines where only 1 soil variable is NA? 

AW: If clay is missing, then sand and silt are missing. There are two grid cells where soil texture (clay, sand, silt) are missing, but CaCO3, AWC, and floodplain fraction are not missing. Since they are not complete, I don't want to use them. Therefore, filtering by clay is fine because it takes out any rows that are incomplete. I added a comment to the code about this.

Line 268: Again, very nitpicky, but since we would expect there to be multiple grid cells that are the same minimum distance from that centroid, do you know how the which.min function treats ties? 

AW: If there is more than one closest cell, which.min() will choose the first one in the vector. I think this is fine since we are just borrowing data for a couple cells. We don't really know which one would be better, but at such a coarse scale, we are getting pretty close to the general soil characteristics to those few grid cells (there are only 38 out of ~12,000).

Plots seem sufficient to verify reliability of data processing. 

# Climate

## 2.1 Process Climate

Similar path comments to the previous sections. The read-in data is located outside of the repo so the user would need to edit the paths themselves for the code to run. Also, the saved data in line 63 and re-loaded data in 69 are absolute paths that depend on the user's setup rather than direct paths that would work with any cloned repo.

Line 69: Why are we reloading the data that we just saved? Environment was not cleared. 

Line 132: What is dl? It doesn't appear to occur anywhere else and is outputting an error. 

Line 137: also saved outside the project. 

There are not any trends in the plots that immediately jump out at me other than the fact that everything is highly correlated. However, no obvious formatting errors or reasons to suspect the climate is not processes correctly. 

## 2.2 Gridded Climate
 This one takes forever to run. That's not really a critique, just a thing.
 
 The plots seem both appropriate for checking the data processing and they have no obvious issues.
 
## 2.3 Process Modern Climate

This one took even longer to run. The mid-script saving and loading of the data was helpful for this script. 

Plots seem like a good tool for assessing that data processing makes sense. The plots also do not show any big issues so this processing of climate data seems to be completed successfully. 

## 2.4 Gridded Modern Climate

Since you find the unique grid cells and combine the different data sets in exactly the same way in multiple scripts it may make sense to just save it the first time and load the veg_unique_grid in subsequent analyses. 

Also, it may not be the most important because you have done this analysis several times now but your comments in this section don't really add much understanding of what is happening here. Especially in lines 62 and 67. 

The plots all look good!
